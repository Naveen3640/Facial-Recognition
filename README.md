**Real time attendance system using facial recognition:**

Our Automated Attendance System employs facial recognition technology for streamlined tracking, achieving 85% accuracy. Utilizing a Tkinter UI, it automates enrollment, model training, and real-time attendance capture. Data is managed in MongoDB and CSV backends, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. With features like multi-threaded model training and real-time face detection, it offers a robust solution for educational institutions.

**About**
Our project introduces an innovative Automated Attendance System leveraging facial recognition technology to streamline traditional attendance tracking methods. Developed as a fourth-year project, this system aims to eradicate manual efforts associated with attendance monitoring, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 85%. The system, tailored initially for English and Hindi lectures, exhibits scalability to accommodate additional subjects seamlessly. Operated through a user-friendly Tkinter interface, the system automates processes from student enrollment to attendance capture, utilizing Keras Sequential layers and a Softmax function for model training. Data management is facilitated through MongoDB and CSV backends, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of attendance records. By eliminating manual tasks and providing real-time attendance tracking, our system offers a sophisticated solution to enhance administrative efficiency within educational institutions.
